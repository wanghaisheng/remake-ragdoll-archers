How to Play
-----------

### Line up your shots carefully, and fire!

Starting with the basic arrows and baseline stats, you will be faced with various enemies. Some of these enemies are trickier than others to beat due to armor, position, and other factors. Every now and then, you will face a giant enemy. This is like a mini-boss level, and you will earn lots of skulls for defeating them.

### Survive for as long as possible

Your goal is to survive for as long as possible and earn as many skulls as you can. The best way to survive for a long time is to keep hitting the apples. Throughout the game you will notice flying apples. Shoot your arrow through the apples to replenish your health, stamina, or both. Here’s how the apples work:

*   Red apple = health
*   Green apple = stamina
*   Golden apple = Health and stamina

### Customize your ammunition

There is an ever-increasing range of arrows to unlock the more you play the game. It’s best to keep playing and switching the arrow types to learn which ones are more powerful and suit your playing style. There is everything from electric and poison to balloon and axe and you can increase your arrow slots to hold more of them at once.

### Use your skulls to upgrade your abilities

You earn skulls by killing enemies which rewards a certain amount based on the power of the foe you defeated. You can upgrade your health, stamina, damage, and more using this currency.
